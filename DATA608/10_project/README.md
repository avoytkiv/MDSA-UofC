# Exploring crypto microstructure

In this project, we have created a complete data pipeline for exploring crypto microstructure using AWS. The data collection process involves collecting live streaming data from Binance exchange using the WebSocket API. The collected data is processed using Python scripts deployed as Docker containers on an EC2 instance and stored the data into an S3 bucket. CloudWatch is used for monitoring and managing resources in AWS.
