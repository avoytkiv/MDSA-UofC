Even though the input is _three_ lists, meaning `3x3` matrix, I decided to expand to `nxn` matrix, which is easy to adjust - just expand the number of lists with proper length and change the first line of code inside of the function (where the matrix is created).  \n",

I recalled that everything in Python is an object and I was creating a list of elements all pointing to the same object (cpoies of the same list).

    "There are plenty of tools that I can use to organize and store my data - _data types_. And when the problem is simple, it is obvious what tool you need to take out of the box to solve it. But when it becomes more complex, the number of ways you can solve it grows exponentially, and only a few are efficient and scalable.\n",

    "When I arrived in Canada just a few weeks ago, I brought all my belongings with me. And when I moved-in into a new house, the challenge was \"how should I organize everything ?\". In the beginning, it was like a _set_ - a _collection of unordered_ things in the middle of an unfurnished unit. Then I created one broad category - clothes with multiple _sublists_ - summer, fall and winter. Eventually, I populated my _collections_ with _ordered_ items, and now I can easily _retrieve_ suitable, _indexed_ clothes depending on the weather. As the winter is coming, I had to buy new warm boots and a jacket which I can easily _add_ to my collections. But first, I will have to free up _space_ in my dresser as the storage is limited, so that I will _remove_ T-shirts to my set of stuff in the basement. Probably, I will _rearrange_ things as time pass by.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when I think about this problem, how to arrange things in my place or how to organize data, it really comes to \"what is my final goal ?\". Do I want to save space because in the future I will have to buy more clothes or maybe I don't have to think about the future and solve the current problem, which will save time for me? During this assignment, I bumped into these dilemmas a couple of times, for example, solving a triple product problem. \n",

    "Other findings from this assignment were: 1) be careful with the division, which leads to the floating point error due to restricted memory space (Part A, Problem 1) and 2) everything is an object in Python and has its place, so be careful when creating copies. "
