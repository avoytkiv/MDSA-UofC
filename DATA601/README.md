# DATA 601 - Working with Data and Visualization 
Provides a review of basic programming concepts in Python, as well as an introduction to problem-solving concepts including algorithmic complexity, recursion, vectorization, and regular expressions.

The course curriculum includes the following technologies and topics mastered by me:

[Assignment 1](assignments/HW1.ipynb): 
- Explore built-in data types in Python;
- Review fundamental programming and problem solving concepts with Python;
- Implement functions based on mathematical concepts and definitions.


[Assignment 2](assignments/HW2.ipynb): 
- Explore collection classes in Python by applying them to probelms.
- Use intermediate level data structures and programming concepts in the context of data related problems.

[Assignment 3](assignments/HW3.ipynb): 
- Work with realworld datasets that can be compared to a model.
- Apply vectorization concepts to iterative problems.
- Explore different programming paradigms to solve problems.


[Assignment 4](assignments/HW4.ipynb): 
- Work with realworld datasets that can be represented using tabular data structures.
- Gain experience wrangling and organizing data using pandas.
- Produce visualizations summarizing information from tabular data.
