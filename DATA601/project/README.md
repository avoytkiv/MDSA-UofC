# DATA601-SP500-exploratory-analysis

[Notebook plus code](project.ipynb)

The **guiding questions** that will be addressed in this investigation are:

1. _How S&P 500 is structured, what are the components, and how is the final price calculated? What sectors and industries are there? Who are the leaders in each one of them?_

The US Stock market is like a huge supermarket with many departments and goods. This question will help us to navigate and eventually construct our basket.

2. _How random are markets? Are there fat tails? How the distribution of market returns compares to the normal distribution?_

We will confirm that market returns does follow normal distribution and can use this as a risk management tool, i.e. volatility targeting.

3. _Are there any seasonal patterns in the stock market?_

We will prove or disprove such well-known seasonalities as the Santa Claus Rally, Sell in May And Go Away, etc.

4. _Are there any momentum effects? Does past performance determine future ones?_

Momentum is a well-known phenomenon in the stock market. Simply put, what goes up will continue going up and vice versa or the winners keep winning.

**Why?**

These questions will be important in observing the behaviour of S&P 500 stock market index in market over the years and will help us identify seasonalities in the market if any, randomness in the market, momentum effects etc.
This will help us define tactics that a novice retail investor might be able to exploit to book some profits in the market without the substantial capital or using all the prediction algorithms that this big investing firm uses.
