We will be using a table generated by Statistics Canada (2022), based upon census data, about the knowledge of languages by area in Canada. This table has been pre-cleaned (although potentially not entirely) so that you can work on the actual assignment more quickly.\n",

    "To answer this question I studied the data and found out that the column named `Knowledge of languages (324)` has parent-child hierarchy, meaning there are subgroups of languages. For example, Celtic languages group consists of Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Celtic languages, n.i.e.\n",
    "1. I don't want to count **parent languages** (group name languages) as _unique_.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the first glance, there is a pattern - language attribute that ends with `%languages` is parent group's name. SPOILER: that's not the case!\n",
    "On the same web page as the data source I found metadata (Link below in this cell) that assigns code to language and it's parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "To find if the language is _unique_ it **shouldn't be a parent** to any other languages. Technically it means that numbers from a column `Member ID` (language code) should not appear in a column `Parent Member ID` (parent language code for that language).\n",
    "How I implemented this:\n",
    "1. Loaded the metadata from the link in the bottom of this cell;\n",
    "2. Cleaned (removed all unused columns except `Member ID` (language), `Member ID` and `Parent Member ID`) in Excel;\n",
    "3. Read this CSV file using pandas (variable name in this notebook `df_metadata`);\n",
    "4. Loaded to database with sqlalchemy;\n",
    "5. Created a VIEW that is a merge of the main dataset and metadata and calculated conditional column if the language is unique:\n",
    "    1. Changed some column names from main dataset to save space;\n",
    "    2. Joined two datasets on Language name;\n",
    "    3. Calculated column if language is in Parent, meaning if it's a parent to other languages. If not, then it's unique (with value 1). The column name `Unique_flag`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "The difference between two ways of doing this (1. remove \"%languages\"; 2. check metadata) is only one language that is `Hmong-Mien languages`. The last one is the unique language because it _doesn't have any children languages_. This can be confirmed with metadata. And removing this one with filtering text is a **mistake**.\n",

There are only 10 single responses (10 people from Sweden that don't speak any other language except their own language). And there are almost 15 thousands people from Sweden who can speak two or more languages (this is an assumption, as people from Norway can speak Swedish as well and can be included in this number).\n",

This confused me initially, as you have to split the process into a few steps and use the result of one \"select\" as an input for another - inside-out sequence. I often checked the result of one simple query to see if I was getting the desired result before complicating it - debugging in SQL is not straightforward.\n",
