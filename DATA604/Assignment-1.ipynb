    "The problematic part of this assignment was retrieving data from JSON \"travel\" file,  as the file was semi-structured. While this is one of the features of JSON format that allows flexibility to store data, I had to spend some time learning the file's schema, which is relatively small. Even though we naturally strive for structure, this is an excellent way to organize more complex data. Why? Because it is hard to define structure/schema in the beginning, as many things can change during the process. In our example, someone tried to organize his trip from Vancouver to Calgary and added another sub-trip from Calgary to Banff. That is what usually happens in practice when we go through some process of doing something.\n",
    "The function of retrieving data \"get_rows\" was complicated, even though I tried to make it as scalable as possible.\n",
    "I learnt that there is no best way to collect data as combining different ways of doing this is the best option. For example, I can collect in a semi-structured way and then parse JSON files into structured tables (CSV files)."
